### AWS EC2 INSTANCE

Assuming you choose a t3a.micro instance for simplicity, which is a cost-effective option.
Monthly cost: $0.0108 per hour _ 24 hours/day _ 30 days/month = $7.776.

### Data Transfer OUT to Internet:

AWS offers 100GB of data transfer out to the internet for free each month.
For simplicity, let's assume your blog generates 10GB of additional data transfer out per month.
Monthly cost: (10GB - 100GB free) \* $0.09 per GB = $0.90.

### Total Estimated Monthly Cost:

EC2 Instance Cost + Data Transfer Cost = $7.776 + $0.90 = $8.676.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
